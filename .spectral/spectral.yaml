# you can omit the reporter section entirely (you'll get a stylish reporter by default)
reporter:
    outputs:
        stylish: {}         # nice looking CLI reports
        # stylish: { html: "output.html" }  # produce HTML reports
        # stylish: { csv: "output.csv" }  # produce CSV reports

        # log:              # use a logger
        #   json: true      # enable JSON logging
        #   file: out.json  # put output in a file

        # junit: {}        # Great for integrating with CI systems that understand JUnit XML (all of them, probably)
        # ignores: {}      # A reporter output that streams results as ignores
